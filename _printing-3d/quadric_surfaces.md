This set of quadric surfaces include an ellipsoid, hyperbolic paraboloid, elliptic paraboloid, hyperboloid of one sheet, hyperboloid of two sheets, and a cone. The models stand roughly 6 inches tall each. See the [Instructions for Creating STL Files]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/GuideToSurfaces.pdf){:target="_blank"} for information on how these models where developed using [CalcPlot3D](https://c3d.libretexts.org/CalcPlot3D/index.html){:target="_blank"} .
