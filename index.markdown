I am a former professor of mathematics looking to transition from academia to industry as a data scientist. I am experienced in developing research questions, collecting and analyzing data, and producing insights based on data analysis. I am skilled in data visualization and database development with a proven ability to communicate effectively with technical and non-technical audiences. I am open to new opportunities (remote or based in the Denver area) that allow me to continue to learn and bring my expertise to a collaborative and outcome-driven team.
